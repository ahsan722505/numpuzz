It is a platform for online number puzzle games
It has two games :

Number Riddle : In this game user is required to slide the
tiles to form a required pattern. A timer is there that records
time it took to solve the puzzle. There are 6 levels. Best
Score(time) is recorded for every level. There is a feature of
leaderboard that lists the top scorers of each level.

Connect Four : It is a famous two player game in which
player has to connect four dots in any direction. This game
has "Play with friend Mode" and "Bot Mode". User can send
an invite link to his/her friend to play with them remotely.
There is a feature to send messages during game. The game
state is also persisted on site reload. Finally I implemented
an AI bot using minmax algorithm that can also play with
users.
